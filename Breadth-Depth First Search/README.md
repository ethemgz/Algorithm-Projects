The project involves implementing a solution to a game scenario where kids pass a ball to each other based on their strength levels. The implemented solution includes constructing a graph representation of the game, performing BFS to find the minimum passes needed to deliver the ball between two kids, and using DFS to detect cycles in the game. The algorithms used are BFS and DFS, which are fundamental graph traversal algorithms.
