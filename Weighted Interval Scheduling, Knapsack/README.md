This project aims to optimize the scheduling of events in various venues to maximize attendance and revenue, as well as to allocate resources effectively for upgrading equipment and contracts. It utilizes the Weighted Interval Scheduling algorithm to efficiently schedule events in each venue and the Knapsack algorithm to select the most valuable upgrades within the budget constraints.
