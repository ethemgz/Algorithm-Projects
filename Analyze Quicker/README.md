The aim of this project is to efficiently calculate statistics (mean, standard deviation, and 5-figure summary) of an online data stream representing household electric power consumption, utilizing appropriate data structures such as arrays, binary search trees, and heaps to optimize runtime.
Additionally, the project requires a report detailing the chosen data structures, their implementation, pseudocode, asymptotic upper bounds, and an evaluation of runtime performance using recorded operation times and method calls for different input scenarios.
